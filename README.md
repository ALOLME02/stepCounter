# About the project - "Personal Companion"

The requirement for numerous functions in a single app is expanding and becoming important as the number of apps increases and challenges with maintainability and storage arise. "Personal Companion," the proposed solution, contains tools for keeping track of spending, taking notes, and calculating the user's steps. The database is SQLite, and the program is created with flutter.
